# Yazelix v4.1

## Overview

Yazelix integrates yazi, zellij and helix, hence the name, get it?

- Zellij orchestrates everything, with yazi as a sidebar and helix as the editor
- You can open and close the sidebar by switching zellij layouts (press `alt ]` and `alt [`)
  - Or if you only got one pane open, make it fullscreen (`ctrl p + f` or `alt f`)
- Every keybinding from zellij that conflicts with helix is remapped (see them at the bottom)
- Helix is called when you hit enter on a file in the "sidebar"
  - If helix is already open, in a pane next to the sidebar, it will open in a new buffer on that pane (magic)
  - Note: It is highly recommended that you let the shell script execute in peace, so during these milliseconds don't move around
- This project holds my config files for zellij and yazi, almost like a plugin or something
  - But it's just some config files with a bit of shell scripting!

## Improvements of the v4.1 over v4

- The open_file script is now written in nushell, with some modifications:
  - Now working with files with spaces in the filename
  - Now more sensitive to detecting hx on the next pane... previously it would sometimes not detect helix and thus open hx in a new pane instead of just opening the file in a new buffer the way it should)
  - Now it cds into the folder of the file being opened, if you clicked on a file, or into the folder itself, if you clicked on a folder 
  - I do prefer quite a lot being able to write nushell instead of bash
- Nushell is now a dependency (technically not an improvement, but feels like one, for me)

## Improvements of the v4 over v3

- ROUNDED CORNERS
- A wish come true: when you hit enter in a file or folder in yazi, if helix is open in a pane next to yazi, it will open in a helix buffer
  - All it took was some shell scripting magic...
  - It will also change your working dir, so when you press `SPACE f` you open the picker in that folder you're actually in
- New-tab layout has improved. Now new panes are just yazi in a 100% width pane, working sort of like a picker.
  - You just open a file or folder from yazi and it goes to its proper place as a sidebar to the right
- Added a dedicated kb to make panes full screen `alt f`
- The repo was previously called `zellij` so people could just clone it in their `.config` folder directly, but this just sounded off. 
  - The project's name is yazelix, not zellij, after all. So now the repo name is yazelix the way god intended
  - Take a look at the new instructions to set it up just below!

## Instructions to set it up

1. Make sure [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi), [zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij), [helix](https://helix-editor.com), and [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/book/installation.html) are installed and in your path
2. Just clone this repo in your `~/.config` dir
3. Take a look at the `configure wezterm` step on [https://github.com/luccahuguet/rustifier](https://github.com/luccahuguet/rustifier#installation) to see how to configure yazelix on wezterm  
    - If you use another shell, you have to configure it to run something like `nu -c "zellij -l welcome --config-dir ~/.config/yazelix/zellij options --layout-dir ~/.config/yazelix/zellij/layouts"` on startup  
    - or `zellij -l welcome --config-dir ~/.config/yazelix/zellij options --layout-dir ~/.config/yazelix/zellij/layout` (but you still need `nu` anyways)
    - Another option, if you wish, run this command manually every time you open yazelix  
    - The recommended shell is Wezterm though. More on that in the Notes section below  
4. Optional: Using zoxide enhances the yazelix experience ten-fold, let me tell ya... and it integrates with yazi

That's it, and feel free to open issues and PRs ðŸ˜‰

## Why use this project?

- This project is relatively simple to understand, the inner workings and all. Just a bit of shell scripting magic, but mostly config files
- Easy to configure and make it yours
- I daily drive this, and will change it according to my needs, keeping it updated and improving it
- Zero conflict keybindings, very powerful sidebar (learning yazi is a process, but you can do very cool stuff)

## Possible Improvements

- Yazelix will only detect helix if it's adjacent to the sidebar. A minor thing.
- When you open a new tab, yazi opens as single pane taking all space
  - But it does not show the parents and preview columns, it only shows the current dir column
  - To address this I would have to reopen yazi with a different config? 
- The opening of files in a helix buffer implementation works but feels like a workaround. But it does not matter much. Helix will get a plugin system and then a file tree plugin probably between the beginning and middle of 2025 anyways.. 

## Keybinding remaps

| New Zellij Keybinding | Previous Keybinding | Helix Action that uses that previous key | Zellij Action remapped    |
|-----------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Ctrl e                | Ctrl o              | jump_backward                            | SwitchToMode "Session"      |
| Ctrl y                | Ctrl s              | save_selection                           | SwitchToMode "Scroll"       |
| Alt w                 | Alt i               | shrink_selection                         | MoveTab "Left"              |
| Alt q                 | Alt o               | expand_selection                         | MoveTab "Right"             |
| Alt m                 | Alt n               | select_next_sibling                      | NewPane                     |
| Alt 2                 | Ctrl b              | move_page_up                             | SwitchToMode "Tmux"         |

If you find a conflict, please open an issue. Keep in mind, though, that compatibility with tmux mode is not a goal of this project.

## Details: Base Layout

The initial layout includes one usable pane (actually 4, counting the tab-bar, status-bar and sidebar):
![image](https://github.com/luccahuguet/zellij/assets/27565287/c8333411-b6f4-4c0e-9ea8-1992859c8749)

- **Tab-bar** at the top
- **Status-bar** at the bottom
- **Yazi pane** (20% width) acting as a sidebar on the left
- **Empty pane** on the right
  
## Discoverability of keybindings
- zellij: zellij is great at this, works out of the box, you'll visually see all the keybindings in the status-bar
- helix: helix is the same honestly
- yazi: There is only one keybinding to remember: `~` This shows all keybindings and commands, but make youre you are on yazi full pane (or press `alt f`) or it will be too cramped to read
- nushell: you can run `tutor` on nushell, you can read the https://www.nushell.sh/book/, you can run `help commands | find regex` (if you want to learn about regex for example, but could be anything) 
    - well, I do use `ctrl r` a lot in nushell, it opens a interactive history search
  
## Notes

- You can add more swap layouts as needed, using the KDL files in `layouts`.
- I recommend using wezterm as your terminal
  - because it can be configured to remove its native tabs, very extensible, including its keybindings (haven't found a conflict yet)
  - very performant
- Use [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/), it's a great shell, it's fast and beautiful and a proper programming language. Why wouldn't you?
- If you test this with nvim and it works, let me know (see the issue [here](https://github.com/luccahuguet/zellij/issues/2))
- Special thanks to yazi's, zellij's and helix's contributors/maintainers! 
- Yazi's author graciously contributed some lua code to make yazi's status bar look awesome in the small width of a sidebar
  - Thanks for that!

## Contributing to Yazelix

We welcome contributions to Yazelix! Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

### Branch Naming Convention

When creating a new branch to work on an issue, please use the following naming convention:

```
issue_{number-of-issue}
```

For example, if you're working on issue #42, your branch should be named `issue_42`.

We follow a "one branch per issue" approach to keep changes focused and manageable.

### Commit Messages

For commit messages, please use the following format:

```
#{issue-number} {commit description}
```

For example, a commit addressing issue #42 might look like:

```
#42 Add rounded corners to sidebar
```

This helps in easily tracking which commits are related to specific issues.

### Workflow

1. **Choose an issue** to work on or create a new one if needed.
2. **Create a new branch** following the naming convention above.
3. **Make your changes** in your branch, adhering to the existing code style.
4. **Commit your changes** using the commit message format described above.
5. **Push your branch** to your fork on GitHub.
6. **Open a pull request** against the `main` branch of the Yazelix repository.
7. **Describe your changes** in the PR description, linking to the relevant issue(s).
